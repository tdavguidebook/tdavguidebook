# Overview
## Introduction
Welcome to the Northern Michigan University Theatre and Dance Audio-Visual Program. We extend our warmest greetings to you as you embark on this journey with us. Our esteemed program is committed to excellence in providing comprehensive training and hands-on experience in advanced audio and visual technologies. Here, you will have the opportunity to engage with cutting-edge techniques and contribute to the high standards of theatrical and dance productions. We are dedicated to fostering a scholarly and innovative environment that supports both artistic and technical development. We look forward to your participation and contributions to our distinguished program.
## An Integrated Ecosystem for AV Education
Our program is designed around internal standardizations that align with industry best practices. It features specialized roles, each supported by a personalized, in-depth curriculum. Centralized resources, accessible through this Guidebook, facilitate comprehensive learning. Additionally, our structured team environment allows members to explore and experience a variety of roles, enhancing their versatility and expertise.
## A Workflow Based Curriculum
Our theatre AV course is designed to immerse students in hands-on workflows rather than traditional academic study of isolated topics and terms. By focusing on practical application, students engage directly with the equipment, techniques, and processes that drive live performance, fostering a deeper understanding through real-world experience. However, students who wish to delve deeper into theory are encouraged to do so; ample resources will be made available to support their exploration. This balanced approach allows learners to develop their skills both practically and theoretically, adapting to the dynamic demands of the theatrical environment.
Why is this Guidebook Online?
## Non-Linear Learning
Learning isn't always as straightforward as it might seem, particularly in the AV curriculum. You may find yourself navigating between chapters or diving into unexpected areas to gain a clearer picture. This guidebook is organized around roles and their respective workflows rather than following a strict chapter sequence. As students engage with the material both as a group and individually within their specific roles, the structure is intentionally non-linear. This approach not only accommodates various learning paces and focuses but also encourages exploration of related topics—often leading students down interesting rabbit holes. Such exploration supports a deeper, more comprehensive understanding and mirrors the real-world process of discovering interconnected concepts and solving complex problems.
## Centralized Course Content
The Guidebook is available online to improve accessibility and streamline the delivery of course materials. By digitizing the Guidebook, students can easily access comprehensive online manuals and tutorials, reflecting the digital nature of our field. This format offers several benefits, including support for text-to-speech services, adjustable text sizes, and direct links to external resources like video tutorials. It also allows instructors to concentrate on foundational concepts during class while students explore the more intricate aspects of their roles through the online content. The Guidebook acts as a centralized hub for essential resources, providing a solid foundation for the standards and practices of the Theatre and Dance Audio-Visual program.
## A Work in Progress
This guidebook will be updated at the end of each term to address the evolving needs of the program and the ever-changing landscape of AV technologies and technical theatre practices. Additionally, I would like to include a second part to the guidebook on Creative Sound & Media Design, but for its first entry the guidebook’s focus should be building up the TDAV Crew. A Creative Design section could easily fill its own guidebook. Though it may undergo some updates, the primary goal remains to provide a solid understanding of the various roles within the TDAV crew, foundational concepts for the AV engineer, and a comprehensive overview of the Northern Michigan University Theatre & Dance Sound & Media Program. With a resource like this, I believe the Sound & Media program will gain significant benefits and, hopefully, achieve national recognition, attracting more opportunities and students.
