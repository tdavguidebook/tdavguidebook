# Overview
## Introduction
Welcome to the Northern Michigan University Theatre and Dance Audio-Visual Program. We extend our warmest greetings to you as you embark on this journey with us. Our esteemed program is committed to excellence in providing comprehensive training and hands-on experience in advanced audio and visual technologies. Here, you will have the opportunity to engage with cutting-edge techniques and contribute to the high standards of theatrical and dance productions. We are dedicated to fostering a scholarly and innovative environment that supports both artistic and technical development. We look forward to your participation and contributions to our distinguished program.
### An Integrated Ecosystem for AV Education
Our program is designed around internal standardizations that align with industry best practices. It features specialized roles, each supported by a personalized, in-depth curriculum. Centralized resources, accessible through this Guidebook, facilitate comprehensive learning. Additionally, our structured team environment allows members to explore and experience a variety of roles, enhancing their versatility and expertise.
### A Workflow Based Curriculum
Our theatre AV course is designed to immerse students in hands-on workflows rather than traditional academic study of isolated topics and terms. By focusing on practical application, students engage directly with the equipment, techniques, and processes that drive live performance, fostering a deeper understanding through real-world experience. However, students who wish to delve deeper into theory are encouraged to do so; ample resources will be made available to support their exploration. This balanced approach allows learners to develop their skills both practically and theoretically, adapting to the dynamic demands of the theatrical environment.
## Why Is This Guidebook on GitHub?

### Non-Linear Learning

Learning in the AV curriculum often involves navigating various topics and sections to build a comprehensive understanding. This guidebook is structured around roles and workflows rather than a linear chapter sequence, reflecting the non-linear nature of real-world learning. This approach supports diverse learning styles and paces, encouraging exploration and a deeper understanding of interconnected concepts.

### Centralized and Collaborative Access

Hosting the Guidebook on GitHub offers several key advantages:

- **Version Control**: GitHub supports version control, allowing for easy updates and ensuring that the content remains current and accurate.
- **Collaborative Input**: Students and instructors can contribute improvements, share insights, and provide feedback directly on the platform.

GitHub enhances accessibility through features like:

- **Text-to-Speech Support**: Facilitates engagement with the material.
- **Adjustable Text Sizes**: Customizes the reading experience.
- **Integration with External Resources**: Links to video tutorials and additional readings.

The platform’s tools for issue tracking and project management facilitate continuous improvement, making it easier to address feedback and adapt the Guidebook based on evolving curriculum needs.

GitHub’s tools and integrations also foster a dynamic and interactive learning environment. Whether through GitHub Pages for a user-friendly interface or other features, the Guidebook is designed to support both individual exploration and collaborative learning. This centralized and adaptable approach aligns with the digital nature of the Theatre and Dance Audio-Visual program and supports ongoing educational growth.

## A Work in Progress
This guidebook will be updated at the end of each term to address the evolving needs of the program and the ever-changing landscape of AV technologies and technical theatre practices. Additionally, I would like to include a second part to the guidebook on Creative Sound & Media Design, but for its first entry the guidebook’s focus should be building up the TDAV Crew. A Creative Design section could easily fill its own guidebook. Though it may undergo some updates, the primary goal remains to provide a solid understanding of the various roles within the TDAV crew, foundational concepts for the AV engineer, and a comprehensive overview of the Northern Michigan University Theatre & Dance Sound & Media Program. With a resource like this, I believe the Sound & Media program will gain significant benefits and, hopefully, achieve national recognition, attracting more opportunities and students.

# Syllabus
## Course Description
Sound & Media Engineering is a technical course designed to provide students with the resources and experience necessary to install and operate AV equipment for the Theatre. The preliminary portion of the course will be delivered in the form of seminars, covering the various roles of the NMU TDAV team. The secondary portion of the course, though just as important, will involve practicing the skills taught through assigned roles on the TDAV team. Role assignments will rotate regularly based on student interests, skill requirements, and production needs.
## Course Objectives
1. To create a technical team capable of effectively installing and operating AV systems for the various music, theatre, and dance venues on campus.
2. To facilitate technical sound and media engineering by teaching foundational AV concepts and providing the necessary tools, resources, and locations for students to work on both internal and external productions.
3. To standardize theatrical AV practices on the NMU campus.
4. To prepare students for the workforce in the fields of AV for theatre, dance, and music by providing them with foundational knowledge, skills, and experience.
## Attendance, Performance, & Accommodations
Students are expected to attend and participate in all sessions and fulfill the duties of their assigned event roles in order to pass the course. There will be no traditional paper exams. Instead, students will be demonstrating their skills regularly through their work within their assigned role. Accommodations will be made upon request to the course instructor and/or the necessary collegiate staff.

## Grading
Course grading is based on the performance of AV duties during assigned theatre productions. Attendance is mandatory; any absence will result in a grade of 0% for the related assignment. The grading scale is as follows
- A (90% - 100%): Exceptional performance; duties were performed with excellence and demonstrated outstanding competence.
- B (80% - 89%): Above-average performance; duties were executed effectively and surpassed typical expectations.
- C (70% - 79%): Satisfactory performance; duties were completed at an acceptable and average level.
- D (60% - 69%): Below-average performance; duties were performed poorly, with notable deficiencies.
- F (0% - 59%): Unsatisfactory performance; failed to meet basic requirements and/or was frequently absent.
