## Workflow 4.1.2: Miking a 4-Piece Drum Kit

Learning to mic a drum kit is a great place to start learning the various microphone types and placements.

### Suggested Equipment

- **Drum Kit**: With throne, rug, riser, drumsticks
- **Microphones with Respective Clips**:
  - **Kick**: Large-diaphragm dynamic mic (e.g., Shure Beta 52A)
  - **Snare**: Standard dynamic mic (e.g., Shure SM57)
  - **Toms**: Small Tom Mics (e.g., Sennheiser e604) x2
  - **Overheads**: Condenser Mics (e.g., AKG C1000) x2
  - **Hi-Hat**: Pencil Condenser Mic (e.g., Sennheiser e614)
- **Microphone Stands**:
  - Short kick stand x1
  - Tall boom stand x3-4
- **XLR Cables**: Medium Length 15-25 ft x7
- **8-Channel XLR Snake**

### 1. Setup

1. **Set Up Drum Kit and Tune**: Assemble and tune the drum kit to ensure optimal sound quality.
2. **Collect Equipment**: Gather all necessary microphones, stands, cables, and the XLR snake.
3. **Setup Mic Stands and Mics**: Position the microphone stands and attach the microphones.
4. **Plug in XLR Cables**: Route the XLR cables into the snake and keep cable runs tidy. Coil excess cables at the base of their respective mic stands rather than at the snake to avoid cable buildup.
   - **Channel 1**: Kick Drum
   - **Channel 2**: Snare Drum
   - **Channel 3 & 4**: Toms
   - **Channel 5 & 6**: Overheads
   - **Channel 7**: Hi-Hat

### 2. Microphone Placement

- **Kick Drum**: Place the mic just inside or outside the hole of the kick drum, aimed at the beater impact point.
- **Snare Drum**: Position the mic 1-2 inches above the drumhead, pointing towards the center.
- **Toms**: Place the mic close to the rim of the tom, aimed at the center of the drumhead.
- **Overheads**: Position the mics in an XY or spaced pair configuration above the drum kit, around 3-4 feet high.

### 3. Test and Balance

1. **Testing**: If available, have the drummer play the kit and adjust microphone positions and gain levels on the console. Otherwise, have a member of the TDAV Crew test the kit while the engineer adjusts mix settings. (Refer to Workflow 3.1.3)
