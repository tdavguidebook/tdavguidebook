   - Choose between static IP or DHCP:
     - **Static IP:** Manually enter an IP address, subnet mask, and gateway that fits your network configuration.
     - **DHCP:** Ensure DHCP is enabled if you want the device to automatically obtain network settings.

3. **Configure Other Network Settings**
   - **DNS Settings:** If necessary, enter DNS server addresses.
   - **Network Mode:** Set the device to operate in the appropriate network mode (e.g., Full-duplex or Half-duplex).

4. **Apply and Save Changes**
   - Save the network settings and apply the changes.
   - The BirdDog Mini may restart to apply new settings.

## Step 4: Integrating with Other Devices

1. **Check Connectivity**
   - Ensure that the BirdDog Mini is communicating properly with other network devices.
   - Verify network traffic to and from the BirdDog Mini using network monitoring tools if needed.

2. **Configure Video and Audio Settings**
   - In the configuration interface, set up video encoding, resolution, and audio settings according to your needs.
   - Test the input and output to ensure proper signal routing.

3. **Verify Device Integration**
   - Ensure that the BirdDog Mini is properly integrated with other equipment such as switchers, routers, or production systems.
   - Test the end-to-end signal flow to confirm that video and audio signals are transmitted correctly.

## Step 5: Troubleshooting
