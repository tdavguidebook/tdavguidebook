## Workflow 1.3.1 Sending Assets to a Client using Frame.io

1. **Log in to Frame.io:**
   - Open your web browser and go to [Frame.io](https://www.frame.io/).
   - Log in using your credentials.

2. **Upload Your Video or Audio Assets:**
   - Once logged in, you'll be on your project dashboard.
   - Navigate to the project where the assets are located or create a new project if necessary.
   - Click on the "Upload" button (usually a cloud icon with an arrow) to select the video or audio files from your computer.
   - Alternatively, you can drag and drop files.

3. **Organize and Review Files:**
   - After uploading, Frame.io will process the files. Once processed, you can organize them into folders if needed.
   - Preview each asset to ensure it's correctly uploaded and plays back smoothly. This step is crucial to catch any issues early.

4. **Set Permissions and Access:**
   - Decide who will have access to the uploaded assets. You can set permissions at both the project and asset levels.
   - Typically, you would want to grant access to your client. Ensure they have the necessary permissions to view and, if needed, download the files.

5. **Create a Review Link (Optional):**
   - Frame.io allows you to create a shareable review link that you can send directly to your client.
   - Navigate to the asset you want to share, click on the share icon (usually represented by a person with a plus sign), and generate a review link.
   - Customize the permissions and expiration date of the link as per your needs.

6. **Share the Files with Your Client:**
   - Depending on your preference, you can either:
     - Share the direct links to the assets within Frame.io by copying and pasting them into an email or communication tool.
     - Use the generated review link to provide your client with easy access to view and comment on the assets directly on Frame.io.

7. **Receive Feedback and Collaborate:**
   - Clients can leave comments, annotations, and even draw directly on the video timeline for precise feedback.
   - Monitor the comments and feedback provided by your client to understand their requirements and make necessary adjustments.

8. **Finalize and Download (If Necessary):**
   - Once the review process is complete and any required changes are made, finalize the assets.
   - If your client needs final copies for download, ensure the files are approved and make them available for download within Frame.io.

9. **Close Out the Project:**
   - After the client has downloaded the final assets (if applicable) and you've received final approval, you can consider the project closed.
   - Archive the project on Frame.io or organize files as per your internal processes for future reference.

10. **Maintain Communication:**
    - Throughout the process, maintain clear communication with your client via Frame.io or other channels to ensure a smooth workflow and address any questions or concerns promptly.
