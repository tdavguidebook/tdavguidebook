## Course Description
Sound & Media Engineering is a technical course designed to provide students with the resources and experience necessary to install and operate AV equipment for the Theatre. The preliminary portion of the course will be delivered in the form of seminars, covering the various roles of the NMU TDAV team. The secondary portion of the course, though just as important, will involve practicing the skills taught through assigned roles on the TDAV team. Role assignments will rotate regularly based on student interests, skill requirements, and production needs.
