## Course Description
Sound & Media Engineering is a technical course designed to provide students with the resources and experience necessary to install and operate AV equipment for the Theatre. The preliminary portion of the course will be delivered in the form of seminars, covering the various roles of the NMU TDAV team. The secondary portion of the course, though just as important, will involve practicing the skills taught through assigned roles on the TDAV team. Role assignments will rotate regularly based on student interests, skill requirements, and production needs.
## Course Objectives
1. To create a technical team capable of effectively installing and operating AV systems for the various music, theatre, and dance venues on campus.
2. To facilitate technical sound and media engineering by teaching foundational AV concepts and providing the necessary tools, resources, and locations for students to work on both internal and external productions.
3. To standardize theatrical AV practices on the NMU campus.
4. To prepare students for the workforce in the fields of AV for theatre, dance, and music by providing them with foundational knowledge, skills, and experience.
# Attendance, Performance, & Accommodations
Students are expected to attend and participate in all sessions and fulfill the duties of their assigned event roles in order to pass the course. There will be no traditional paper exams. Instead, students will be demonstrating their skills regularly through their work within their assigned role.
